= Get Up and Running Quickly

Generate a new Facebook app at http://www.facebook.com/developers/createapp.php . (You may have to register as a developer first, but I'm not sure.) Once you've generated your app, create a new file called *config/facebook.yml* and copy the App ID and App Secret into it like so:

  app_id: 206609726018345
  app_secret: f2899bd9628ac26e7823e719385d0412
